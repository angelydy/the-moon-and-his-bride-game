    lg"{cps=25} They are now taking him for questioning."

    mc"{cps=25} What?! {p}Why jake?"

    lg"{cps=25} I don’t know the details."
    lg"{cps=25} But from what I heard..."
    lg"{cps=25} They found Jenny’s purse in his room."
    lg"{cps=25} They suspected Jake for to be the one responsible for Jenny."

    mc"{cps=25} I don't get it... Why Jake? He’s Jenny’s cousin."
    mc"{cps=25} He’s not the type of person to have an ulterior motive."
    mc"{cps=25} Why would they think he’d do that?"

    lg"{cps=25} I don’t know... Although it’s not impossible."
    mc"{cps=25} Do you believe them?"

    lg"{cps=25} We all know Jake..."

    lg"{cps=25} He may be an idiot, {p}careless {p}and always up to no good, {p}but he has a kind heart."
    mc"{cps=25} That’s it! We know Jake and I believe he’s not capable of doing that act."
    mc"{cps=25} He may be a bad influence, {p}but he cares for Jenny."
    #show laura neutral
    lg"{cps=25} Yeah and I still can’t believe that he could do such a thing..."
    mc"{cps=25} Listen Jake told me his short story about what happened back then in the canteen."
    mc"{cps=25} He told me he couldn’t remember anything after he got wasted at the party."
    mc"{cps=25} When he woke up the next day, he found himself in his room."
    mc"{cps=25} He also found Jenny’s purse on his side table, so he concluded that Jenny drove him back home."

    lg"{cps=25} He's our friend, but still the evidence is pointing at him."
    mc"{cps=25} I feel something is missing in the story..."
    mc"{cps=25} There's a saying... You can’t know what is happening behind the walls."
    mc"{cps=25} If you're just listening to the sound that comes from the wall."
    mc"{cps=25} Jake is our friend. {p}We know he’s not capable of harming Jenny."
    mc"{cps=25} We only heard the story from the authorities."
    #show laura sad
    lg"{cps=25} I don’t know what to believe anymore."
    lg"{cps=25} I am scared that something bad happened to Jenny..."

    lg"{cps=25} What should we do now?"
    mc"{cps=25} Something is wrong and I can feel it... We should find out more about what happened... I swear to you I will get to the bottom of this..."

    jk"{cps=25} He or she was offering me drinks as the crowd pressured me to drink it."
    jk"{cps=25} I drank... After that Everything was loud and wild that night."
    jk"{cps=25} I can’t remember what happened next..."
    jk"{cps=25} But I am sure that I didn’t black out... {p}Not until I talked to Jenny, before she left."
    jk"{cps=25} After that, I can’t remember anything..."

    jk"{cps=25} But my vision is blurry and I can barely keep myself awake for a few seconds."
    jk"{cps=25} I heard someone whistling a song before I completely lost consciousness."
    jk"{cps=25} The whistling was familiar."
